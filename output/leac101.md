## Accounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts

You have learnt about the preparation of financial statements for a sole proprietary concern. As the business expands, one needs more capital and larger number of people to manage the business and share its risks. In such a situation, people usually adopt the partnership form of organisation. Accounting for partnership firms has it's own peculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into existence when two or more persons come together to establish a business and share its profits. On many issues affecting distribution of profits, there may not be any specific agreement between the partners. In such a situation the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation of interest on capital, interest on drawings and maintenance of partners capital accounts have their own peculiarities. Not only that a variety of adjustments are required on the death of a partner or when a new partner is admitted and so on. These peculiar situations need specific treatment in accounting that need to be clarified.

The present chapter discusses some basic aspects of partnership such as distribution of profit, maintenance of capital accounts, etc. The treatment of situations like admission of partner, retirement, death and dissolution have been taken up in the subsequent chapters.

## 1.1 Nature of Partnership

When two or more persons join hands to set up a business and share its profits and losses, they are said to be in partnership. Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 defines partnership as the

---

'relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all'.

Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually called 'partners' and collectively called 'firm'. The name under which the business is carried is called the 'firm's name'. A partnership firm has no separate legal entity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of partnership are:

- 1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at least two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words, the minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however, a limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the Companies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe maximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can not be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the maximum number of partnership in a firm to be 50.
- 2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or more persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The agreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is not necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement is equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the partners have a written agreement.
- 3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere coownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if Rohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint owners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business of purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will be called partners.
- 4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has two important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate in the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a relationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the other partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound by the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm. Relationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that there would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.
- 5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the agreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a business. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes partnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of a business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and

---

losses is important. If some persons join hands for the purpose of some charitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership.

- 6. Liability of Partners: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm done while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts of the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also be used for paying off the firm's debts.

## 1.2 Partnership Deed

Partnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners. The agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require that the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document, which contains terms of the agreement is called 'Partnership Deed'. It generally contains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the partners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner, ratio in which the profits and the losses will be shared by the partners and entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc.

The clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the partners. The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions of the 'Stamp Act' and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms.

## Contents of the Partnership Deed

The Partnership Deed usually contains the following details:

- · Names and Addresses of the firm and its main business;
- · Names and Addresses of all partners;
- · Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner;
- · The accounting period of the firm;
- · The date of commencement of partnership;
- · Rules regarding operation of Bank Accounts;
- · Profit and loss sharing ratio;
- · Rate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc;
- · Mode of auditor's appointment, if any;
- · Salaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner;
- · The rights, duties and liabilities of each partner;
- · Treatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners;
- · Settlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm;
- · Method of settlement of disputes among the partners;
- · Rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and
- · Any other matter relating to the conduct of business.

Normally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of partners amongst themselves. However, if there is no express agreement on certain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply.

## 1.2.1 Provisions of Partnership Act Relevant for Accounting

The important provisions affecting partnership accounts are as follows:

- (a) Profit Sharing Ratio: If the partnership deed is silent about the profit sharing ratio, the profits and losses of the firm are to be shared equally by partners, irrespective of their capital contribution in the firm.
- (b) Interest on Capital: No partner is entitled to claim any interest on the amount of capital contributed by him in the firm as a matter of right. However, interest can be allowed when it is expressly agreed to by the partners. Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed is silent on the issue.
- (c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made by the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.
- (d) Interest on Loan: If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the purpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the loan amount at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.
- (e) Remuneration for Firm's Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or other remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the firm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.

Apart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to contract between the partners:

- (i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the firm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or the firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.
- (ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing with that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all profit made by him/her in that business.

## Test your Understanding -I

- 1. Mohan and Shyam are partners in a firm. State whether the claim is valid if the partnership agreement is silent in the following matters:
- (i) Mohan is an active partner. He wants a salary of Rs. 10,000 per year;
- (ii) Shyam had advanced a loan to the firm. He claims interest @ 10% per annum;
- (iii) Mohan has contributed Rs. 20,000 and Shyam Rs. 50,000 as capital. Mohan wants equal share in profits.
- (iv) Shyam wants interest on capital to be credited @ 6% per annum.
- 2. State whether the following statements are true or false:
- (i) Valid partnership can be formulated even without a written agreement between the partners;
- (ii) Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the other partners;
- (iii) Maximum number of partners can be 50;
- (iv) Methods of settlement of dispute among the partners can't be part of the partnership deed;

---

- (v) If the deed is silent, interest at the rate of 6% p.a. would be charged on the drawings made by the partner;
- (vi) Interest on partner's loan is to be given @ 12% p.a., if the deed is silent about the rate.

## 1.3 Special Aspects of Partnership Accounts

Accounting treatment for partnership firm is similar to that of a sole proprietorship business with the exception of the following aspects:

- · Maintenance of Partners' Capital Accounts;
- · Distribution of Profit and Loss among the partners;
- · Adjustments for Wrong Appropriation of Profits in the Past;
- · Reconstitution of the Partnership Firm; and
- · Dissolution of Partnership Firm.

The first three aspects mentioned above have been taken up in the following sections of this chapter. The remaining aspects have been covered in the subsequent chapters.

## 1.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners

All transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the firm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought in as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest on drawings, partner's salary, commission to partners, etc.

There are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be maintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital method. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions other than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts of the partners.

- (a) Fixed Capital Method: Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the partners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a part of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners. All items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest on drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner's Current Account. The partners' capital accounts will always show a credit balance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there is any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners' current account on the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under this method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz, capital account and current account, While the partners' capital accounts shall always appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners' current account's balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they have credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance.

The partner's capital account and the current account under the fixed capital method would appear as shown in Fig.1.1.

## Fig. 1.1: Proforma of Partner's Capital and Current Account under Fixed Capital Method.

- (b) Fluctuating Capital Method: Under the fluctuating capital method, only one account, i.e. capital account is maintained for each partner. All the adjustments such as share of profit and loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary or commission to partners, etc are recorded directly in the capital accounts of the partners. This makes the balance in the capital account to fluctuate from time to time. That's the reason why this method is called fluctuating capital method. In the absence of any instruction, the capital account should be prepared by this method. The proforma of capital accounts prepared under the fluctuating capital method is given in Fig.1.2.

## 1.4.1 Distinction between Fixed and Fluctuating Capital Accounts

The main points of differences between the fixed and fluctuating capital methods can be summed up as follows:

| Basis of Distinction               | Fixed Capital                                                                                                               | Fluctuating Capital                                                                                               |                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (i) Number of accounts             | Under this method, two separate accounts are maintained for each partner viz., 'capital account' and 'current account'.     | Each partner has one account, i.e. capital account, under this method                                             |                                                                                                                   |
| (ii) Items related to deed related | Drawings, salary,interest on capital,etc. are posted (transferred) in the current accounts and not in the capital accounts. | All adjustments for drawings, salary interest on capital, etc., are posted (transferred) in the capital accounts, | All adjustments for drawings, salary interest on capital, etc., are posted (transferred) in the capital accounts, |
| (iii) Fixed balance                | The capital account balance remain unchanged unless there is addition to or withdrawal of capital.                          | The balance of the capital account fluctuates from year to year                                                   | The balance of the capital                                                                                        |
| (iv) Credit balance                | The capital accounts always show a credit balance.                                                                          | The capital account may sometimes show a debit balance.                                                           | The capital account                                                                                               |

## 1.5 Distribution of Profit among Partners

The profits and losses of the firm are distributed among the partners in an agreed ratio. However, if the partnership deed is silent, the firm's profits and losses are to be shared equally by all the partners.

You know that in the case of sole partnership the profit or loss, as ascertained by the profit and loss account is transferred to the capital account of the proprietor. In case of partnership, however, certain adjustments such as interest on drawings, interest on capital, salary to partners, and commission to partners are required to be made. For this purpose, it is customary to prepare a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account of the firm and ascertain the final figure of profit and loss to be distributed among the partners, in their profit sharing ratio.

## 1.5.1 Profit and Loss Appropriation Account

Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is merely an extension of the Profit and Loss Account of the firm. It shows how the profits are appropriated or distributed among the partners. All adjustments in respect of partner's salary, partner's commission, interest on capital, interest on drawings, etc. are made through this account. It starts with the net profit/net loss as per Profit and Loss Account. The journal entries for preparation of Profit and Loss Appropriation Account and making various adjustments through it are given as follows:

- 1. Raju and Jai commenced business in partnership on April 1, 2019. No partnership agreement was made whether oral or written. They contributed Rs. 4,000,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively as capitals. In addition, Raju advanced Rs. 2,00,000 as loan to the firm on October 1, 2019. Raju had met with an accident on July 1, 2017 and could not attend the business up to september 30, 2017. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 amounted to Rs, 50,600. Disputes have arisen between them on sharing the profits of the firm.

## Raju Claims:

- (i) He should be given interest at 10% p.a. on capital and so also on loan.
- (ii) Profit should be distributed in the proportion of capitals.

## Jai Claims:

- (i) Net profit should be shared equally.
- (ii) He should be allowed remuneration of Rs, 1,000 p.a. during the period of Raju's illness.
- (iii) Interest on capital and loan should be given @ 6% p.a.

State the correct position on each issue as per the provisions of the Partnership Act. 1932.

- 2. Reena and Raman are partners with capitals of Rs. 3,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. The profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 was Rs. 1,80,000, before paying rent for her personal building to be used as godown for firm to Reena payable at Rs. 5000 per month. Interest on capital is to be allowed at 6% p.a. Raman was entitled to a salary of Rs. 30,000 p.a. The drawings of partners were Rs. 30,000 and 20,000. The interest on drawings to be charged to Reena was Rs. 1,000 and to Raman, Rs. 500.

Assuming that Reena and Raman are equal partners. State their share of profit after necessary appropriations.

Note: Payment of Rent to Reena is an expense for the business. Hence, it is change against profits.

## 1.5.2 Interest on Capital

No interest is allowed on partners' capitals unless it is expressly agreed among the partners. When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is

---

credited to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for which the capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital is generally provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute unequal amounts of capitals but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital contribution is same but profit sharing is unequal.

Interest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or withdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi and Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and losses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners @10 per cent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any partner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000 (10% on 30,000) for Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs. 10,000 (10% on 1,00,000) for Navin.

Take another case of Mansoor and Reshma who are partners in a firm and their capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000 respectively on April 1, 2019. Mansoor introduced additional capital of Rs. 1,00,000 on August 1, 2019 and Reshma brought in further capital of Rs. 1,50,000 on October 1, 2019. Interest is to be allowed @ 6% p.a. on the capitals. It shall be worked as follows:

$$F o r \, M a n s o r \, \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 2, 0, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right ) + \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right ) \times \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right ) \times \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right )$$

$$= R s. 12, 10,000 + R s. 4,000 = R s. 16,000$$

$$F o r \, R e s h m a \, \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 5 0, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right ) + \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 5 0, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right ) \times \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1, 5 0, 0 0 \, \times \, 6 } \right )$$

$$= R s. 9,000+R s. 4,500 = R s. 13,500$$

When there are both addition and withdrawal of capital by the partners during a financial year, the interest on capital is calculated as follows:

- (i) On the opening balance of the capital accounts of partners, interest is calculated for the whole year;
- (ii) On the additional capital brought in by any partner during the year, interest is calculated from the date of introduction of additional capital to the last day of the financial year.
- (iii) In case of withdrawal of capital, interest on capital will be calculated as: On opening capital from the beginning of the year till date of capital withdrawn and then on the reduced capital for the remaining time period. Alternatively, it can be calculated with respect of amount remained in business for the relevant period.

Sometimes opening capitals of partners may not be given. In such a situation before calculation of interest on capital the opening capitals will have to be worked out with the help of partners' closing capitals by marking necessary adjustments for the additions and withdrawal of capital, drawings, share of profit or loss, if already shown in the capital accounts the partners.

## Illustration 6

Josh and Krish are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:1. Their capitals at the end of the financial year 2015-2016 were Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs. 75,000. During the year 2015-2016, Josh's drawings were Rs. 20,000 and the drawings of Krish were Rs. 5,000, which had been duly debited to partner's capital accounts. Profit before charging interest on capital for the year was Rs. 16,000. The same had also been debited in their profit sharing ratio. Krish had brought additional capital of Rs. 16,000 on October 1, 2015. Calculate interest on capital @ 12% p.a. for the year 2015-2016.

Interest on capital will be as 18,960 (12% of Rs. 1,58,000) for Josh and Rs. 960 for Krish calculated as follows:

$$\left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 6 0, 0 0 0 } \times { \frac { 1 2 } { 1 0 0 } } \right ) + \left ( { \mathrm R s. \, 1 6, 0 0 0 } \times { \frac { 1 2 } { 1 0 0 } } \right ) \, \, \,$$

As clarified earlier, the interest on capital is allowed only when the firm has earned profit during the accounting year. Hence, no interest will be allowed during the year the firm has incurred net loss and if in a year, the profit of the firm is less than the amount due to the partners as interest on capital, the payment of interest will be restricted to the amount of profits. In that case, the profit will be effectively distributed in the ratio of interest on capital of each partner.

Anupam and Abhishek are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 2. Their capital accounts showed balances of Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs. 2,00,000 respectively on April 01, 2019. Show the calculation of interest on capital for the year ending December 31, 2020 in each of the following alternatives:

- (a) If the partnership deed is silent as to the payment of interest on capital and the profit for the year is Rs. 50,000;
- (b) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the firm incurred a loss of Rs. 10,000 during the year;
- (c) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the firm earned a profit of Rs. 50,000 during the year;
- (d) If the partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the firm earned a profit of Rs. 14,000 during the year.

## Solution

- (a) In the absence of a specific provision in the Deed, no interest will be paid on the capital to the partners. The whole amount of profit will however be distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio.
- (b) As the firm has incurred losses during the accounting year, no interest on capital will be allowed to any partner. The firm's loss will however be shared by the partners in their profit sharing ratio.

As the profit is sufficient to pay interest at agreed rate, the whole amount of interest on capital shall be allowed and the remaining profit amounting to Rs. 22,000 (Rs. 50,000 - Rs. 28,000) shall be shared by the partners in their profit sharing ratio.

- (d) As the profit for the year is Rs. 14,000, which is less than the amount of interest on capital due to partners, i.e. Rs. 28,000 (Rs. 12,000 for Anupam and Rs. 16,000 for Abhishek), interest will be paid to the extent of available profit i.e., Rs. 14,000. Anupam and Abhishek will be credited with Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 8,000, respectively. Effectively this amounts to sharing the firm's profit in the ratio of interest on capital, i.e., 3:4.

- 1. Rani and Suman are in partnership with fixed capitals of Rs, 80,000 and Rs. 60,000, respectively. During the year 2019-20, Rani withdrew Rs. 10,000 from her capital and Suman Rs. 15,000. Profits before charging interest on capital was Rs. 50,000. Rani and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the amounts of interest on their capitals @ 12% p.a. for the year ended March 31, 2020.
- 2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts, on April 1, 2019 were: Priya, Rs. 6,000,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,000,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended March 31, 2020 was Rs. 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when there was no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is an agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed @ 12% p.a.

## 1.5.3 Interest on Drawings

The partnership agreement may also provide for charging of interest on money withdrawn out of the firm by the partners for their personal use. As stated earlier, no interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement among the partners about it. However if the partnership deed so provides for it, the interest is charged at an agreed rate, for the period for which drawings have been made. Remained outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging interest on drawings discourages excessive amounts of drawings by the partners.

The calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown as here under.

## When Fixed Amounts was Withdrawn Every Month

Many a time, a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners, at equal time interval, say each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period, attention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the beginning (first day) of the month, middle of the month or at the end (last day) of the month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on total amount will be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end at every month, it will be calculated for 5½ months, and if withdrawn during the middle of the month, it will be calculated for 6 months.

Suppose, Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal use during the year ending March 31, 2017. The calculation of average period and the interest on drawings, in different situations would be as follows:

- (a) When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:

Average Period = No. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings = 2

12+1 = 6½ months. 2

---

Interest on Drawings = Rs. 1,20,000×8×13×1 Rs. 5,200. 100×2×12

## (b) When the amount is withdrawn at the end of each month

Average Period = No. of months of 1 drawings + No. of months of last drawings = 2 11+0 = 5 1 2 months

1

months

Interest on Drawings = Rs.1,20,000×8×11×1 Rs. 4,400.

(c) When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month

When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month, nothing is added or deduced from the total period.

Average Period = No. of months of 1 drawings + No. of month of last drawings 11.5+0.5 =

6 months

2 2

Interest on Drawings = Rs.1,20,000×8×6×1 Rs. 4,800.

When Fixed Amount is withdrawn Quarterly

When fixed amount of money is withdrawn quarterly by partners, in such a situation, for the purpose of calculation of interest, the total period of time is ascertained depending on whether the money was withdrawn at the beginning or at the end of each quarter. If the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each quarter, the interest is calculated on the total money withdrawn during the

year, for a period of seven and half months i.e., 2 12+3

end of each quarter it will be calculated for a period of 4½ months, i.e., 2 9+0 9

Suppose Satish and Tilak are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses equally. During financial year 2016-2017, Satish withdrew Rs. 30,000 quarterly. If interest is to be charged on drawings @ 8% per annum, the calculation of average period and interest on drawings will be as follows:

---

- (a) If the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each quarter

| Date          | Amount (Rs.)   | Time Period   | Interest  (Rs.)                 |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| April 1, 2019 | 30,000         | 12 months     | 30,000 × 100  × 1               |
| July 1, 2019  | 30,000         | 9 months      | 30,000 × 12 100  = 1,800        |
| Oct. 1, 2019  | 30,000         | 6 months      | 30,000 × 6  × 8 12 100  = 1,200 |
| Jan. 1, 2020  | 30,000         | 3 months      | 30,000 × 3  × 8 12 100  = 600   |
| Total         | 1,20,000       | = Rs. 6,000   |                                 |

Alternatively, the interest can be calculated on the total amount withdrawn during the accounting year, i.e. Rs. 1,20,000 for a period of 7½ months (12+9+6+3)/4 as follows:

Rs. 1,20,000 × 8 12 100  × 12 12 100

- (b) If the amount is withdrawn at the end of each quarter

Alternatively, the interest can be calculated on the total amount withdrawn during the accounting year, i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 for a period of 4½ months (9 + 6 + 3 + 0)/4 months as follows:

$$= R s. 1,20,000 \times \frac { 8 } { 1 0 0 } \times \frac { 9 } { 2 } \times 1 = R s. 3,6 0$$

## When Varying Amounts are Withdrawn at Different Intervals

When the partners withdraw different amounts of money at different time intervals, the interest is calculated using the product method. Under the product method, for each withdrawal, the money withdrawn is multiplied by the period (usually expressed in months) for which it remained withdrawn during the financial year. The period is calculated from the date of the withdrawal to the last day of the accounting year. The products so calculated are totalled on the total of the products interest at the specified rate is calculated as under:

- 3. Verma and Kaul are partners in a firm. The partnership agreement provides that interest on drawings should be charged @ 6% p.a. Verma withdraws Rs. 2,000 per month starting from April 01, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Kaul withdrew Rs, 3,000 per quarter, starting from April 01, 2019. Calculate interest on partner's drawings.

## When Dates of Withdrawal are not specified

When the total amount withdrawn is given but the dates of withdrawals are not specified, it is assumed that the amount was withdrawn evenly throughout the year. For example; Shakila withdrew Rs. 60,000 from partnership firm during the year ending March 31, 2020 and the interest on drawings is to be charged at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. For calculation of interest, the period would be taken as six months, which is the average period assuming, that amount is withdrawn evenly in the middle of the month, throughout the year. The amount of interest on drawings works out to be Rs. 2,400 as follows:

$$\left ( { \frac { R s. 6 0, 0 0 0 \times { \frac { 8 } { 1 0 0 } } } { 1 0 0 } } \right ) = { \frac { 6 } { 1 2 } } \right ) = { \frac { R s. 2, 4 0 0 } { 2 4 0 } }$$

## 1.6 Guarantee of Profit to a Partner

Sometimes a partner is admitted into the firm with a guarantee of certain minimum amount by way of his share of profits of the firm. Such assurance may be given by all the old partners in a certain ratio or by any of the old partners, individually to the new partner. The minimum guaranteed amount shall be paid to such new partner when his share of profit as per the profit sharing ratio is less than the guaranteed amount. For example, Madhulika and Rakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm, giving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm's profits. The firm earned a profit of Rs.1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit sharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio, Madhulika's share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita, Rs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000). The share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount. This shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in

---

their profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika's share in the deficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000. The total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows Madhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency Rs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000-3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).

If only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita gives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by her only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita Rs. 55,000 (60,000-5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).

| Mohit's capital  (share of profit)  Less: Share in  deficiency Rohan's capital  (share of profit)  Less: Share in  deficiency Rahul's capital  (share of profit)  Add: Deficiency  received from:  Mohit Rohan | 40,000  3,333   | 36,667        | Profit and Loss (Net profit) |

---

## Working Notes:

The new profit sharing ratio after admission of Rahul comes to 2:1:1. As per this ratio the share of partners in the profit comes to:

$$M o h i t \quad = R s. \, 1, 6 0, 0 0 0 \times \frac { 2 } { 4 } \quad = R s. \, 8 0, 0 0 0$$

$$= R s. \, 1, 6 0, 0 0 0 \times \frac { 1 } { 4 } \quad = R s. \, 4 0, 0 0 0$$

$$= R s. \, 1, 6 0, 0 0 0 \times \frac { 1 } { 4 } \quad = R s. \, 4 0, 0 0 0$$

But, since Rahul has been given a guarantee of minimum of Rs. 50,000 as his share of profit. The deficiency of Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 50,000 - Rs. 40,000) shall be borne by Mohit and Rohan in the ratio in which they share profits and losses between themselves, viz. 2:1 as follows:

Mohit's share in deficiency comes to 2/3 × Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 6,667

Rohan's share in deficiency comes to 1/3 × Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 3,333

Thus Mohit will get Rs. 80,000 - Rs. 6,667 = Rs. 73,333, Rohan will get Rs. 40,000-Rs. 3,333 = Rs. 3,333 = Rs. 36,667 and Rahul will get Rs. 40,000+Rs. 6,667+Rs. 3,333 = Rs. 50,000 in the profit of the firm.

Calculation of new profit sharing ratio

The new partner Rahul's share is 1 - 4 . The remaining profit is 1 - 4 . to be shared

between Mohit and Rohan in the ratio of 2:1.

$$M o h i t's \, new \, s h a r e = \frac { 3 } { 4 } \times \frac { 2 } { 3 } = \frac { 2 } { 4 }$$

Rohan's new share = 3 × 1 = 4

$$T h u s, \, N e w \, p r o f \, s h a r i n g \, r a t i o \, c o m \, t o \, b e \, \, 2 \, \cdot \, 1 \, \cdot \, 1 \, \cdot \, 2 \, \cdot \, 1 \, \cdot \, 2 \, \cdot \, 1 \, \cdot \, 4 \, \cdot \, 4 \, \cdot \, 4$$

Working Notes:

Profit after interest on capital is Rs. 90,000, which is to be distributed in the ratio of 3:2:1 as follows: John gets Rs. 45,000 (3/6 × Rs. 90,000), Mathew Rs. 30,000, Mohanty Rs. 15,000. Deficiency of Mohanty from the guaranteed profit of Rs. 15,000 will be borne by John. John will therefore get Rs. 45,000 -Rs. 15,000 = Rs. 30,000, Mathew Rs. 30,000 and Mohanty Rs. 30,000.

Working Notes:

New profit sharing Ratio will be calculated as follows:

Rakesh to share 10 of the profits. The remaining profit 9 will be shared by Mahesh and Dinesh in the ratio of 2:1.

Mahesh's share in profit will be 2 × 9 = 3

Dinesh's share will be 1 × 9 = 3

The New ratio becomes 3 : 3 : 1 or 6 : 3 : 1.

Mahesh's share in profit = 1,20,000 × 6 = Rs. 72,000,

Dinesh's share in profit = Rs. 36,000, 10

Rakesh's share in profit = Rs. 12,000.

Deficiency of Rakesh (Rs. 13,000) will be shared by Mahesh and Dinesh in the ratio of 3:2.

Mahesh will bear 3/5 of 13,000, i.e. Rs. 7,800 and Rakesh, 2/5 of Rs. 13,000, i.e. Rs. 5,200.

Thus, the profits of the firm will be shared as follows.

Mahesh will get Rs. 72,000 - Rs. 7,800 = Rs. 64,200.

Dinesh will get Rs. 36,000 - Rs. 5,200 = Rs. 30,800

Rakesh will get Rs. 12,000 + Rs. 7,800 + Rs. 5,200 = Rs. 25,000.

Both Kavita and Lalita undertake to meet the liability arising out of Guaranteed amount to Mohan in their respective profit sharing ratio. The profit sharing ratio between Kavita and Lalit does not change. The firm earned profits of Rs. 76,000 for the year 2006-07.Show the distribution of profit amongst the partners.

## 1.7 Past Adjustments

Sometimes a few omissions or errors in the recording of transactions or the preparation of summary statements are found after the final accounts have been prepared and the profits distributed among the partners. The omission may be in respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners' loan, partner's salary, partner's commission or outstanding expenses. There may also be some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting having impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission need adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts, necessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through ' Profit and Loss Adjustment Account', or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned partners. This is explained with the help of following example.

Rameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015 were Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial year ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not been credited to the partners' capital accounts before distribution of profit. In this case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners' capital accounts works out to be Rs. 3000 (6/100 × Rs. 50,000) for Rameez and Rs. 6,000 (6/100 × Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer. Had the interest on capital been duly provided, the firm's profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission, the whole amount of profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment of Rs. 9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio, and the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their capital accounts. This error can be rectified in any of the following ways;

## Summary

- 1. Definition of partnership and its essential features: Partnership is defined as "Relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any one of them acting for all". The essential features of partnership are : (i) To form a partnership, there must be at least two persons; (ii) It is created by an agreement; (iii) The agreement should be for carrying on some legal business; (iv) sharing of profits and losses; and (v) relationship of mutual agency among the partners.
- 2. Meaning and contents of partnership deed: A document which contains the terms of partnership as agreed among the partners is called 'Partnership Deed'. It usually contains information about all aspects affecting relationship between partners, including objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner, ratio in which profit and losses will be shared by the partners, entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan and the rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death, dissolution, etc.
- 3. Provisions of Partnership Act 1932 applicable to accounting: If partnership deed is silent in respect of certain aspects, the relevant provisions of the Indian Partnership Act. 1932, become applicable. According to the Partnership Act, the partners share profits equally, no partner is entitled to remuneration, no interest on capital is allowed and no interest on drawings is charged. However, if any partner has given some loan to the firm, he is entitled to interest on such amount @ 6% per annum.
- 4. Preparation of capital accounts under fixed and fluctuating capital methods: All transactions relating to partners are recorded in their respective capital accounts in the books of the firm. There can be two methods of maintaining Capital Accounts. These are; (i) fluctuating capital method, (ii) fixed capital method. Under fluctuating capital method, all the transactions relating to a partner are directly recorded in the capital account. Under fixed capital method, however the amount of capital remains fixed, the transactions like interest on capital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary, commission, share of profit or loss are recorded in a separate account called 'Partner's Current Account'.
- 5. Distribution of profit and loss: The distribution of profits among the partners is shown through a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account, which is merely an extension of the Profit and Loss Account. It is usually debited with interest on capital and salary/commission allowed to the partners, and credited with net profit as per Profit and Loss Account and the interest on drawings. The balance being profit or loss is distributed among the partners in the profit sharing ratio and transferred to their respective capital accounts.

---

- 6. Treatment of guarantee of minimum profit to a partner: Sometimes, a partner may be guaranteed a minimum amount by way of his share in profits. If, in any year, the share of profits as calculated according to his profit sharing ratio is less than the guaranteed amount, the deficiency is made good by the guaranteeing partners' in the agreed ratio which usually is the profit sharing ratio. If, however, such guarantee has been given by any of them, he or they alone shall bear the amount of deficiency.
- 7. Treatment of past adjustments: If, after the final accounts have been prepared, some omission or commissions are noticed say in respect of the interest on capital, interest on drawings, partner's salary, commission, etc. necessary adjustments can be made in the partner's capital accounts through the Profit and Loss Adjustment Account, to rectify the same.
- 8. Preparation of final accounts of a partnership firm: There is not much difference in the final accounts of a sole proprietary concern and that of a partnership firm except that in case of a partnership firm an additional account called Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is prepared to show distribution of profit and loss among the partners.
