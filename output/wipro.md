## 3 Project Management

## 3.1 Project management

Wipro will do the project management for all offshore activities planned during this period. iDirect will take care of the work allocation for the team members stationed onsite.

## 3.1.1 Project Team Organization

The general team organization in Wipro is as shown below. A Delivery Manager (DM) manages one or more accounts / projects and the respective Project Managers (PM) report to him / her. Every Project Manager will have one or more module / project leads reporting to him / her. Project engineers will report to the module / project leads.

<!-- image -->

In case of any employee turnover in the project, Wipro will provide replacements and train them, as required, in a timely manner.

## 3.1.2 Roles and responsibilities

The project manager will monitor the project on a continuous basis and send status reports to the customers on a weekly basis. He / she will be ultimate responsible for resolving all issues internal to the project. In the event of an issue requiring resolution from Wipro, the first point of contact would be the project manager. Any further escalations will be sent to the delivery manager.

The project manager will also participate in program review meetings with the iDirect management (VPs, Directors and Technical Managers from iDirect side) on a periodic basis.

The project leads identified by WIPRO for testing and sustenance will interact with the leads identified for the same from iDirect on a day to day basis. In addition to working on activities allotted to them, the project leads will also be responsible for work allocation, status tracking, review of deliverables, providing technical assistance and direction to their respective team members (as required) from time to time. The project leads will report to WIPRO's project manager and attend the weekly status calls with their iDirect counterparts.

## 3.2 Reporting and monitoring

The Project Manager / Leader will monitor the project on a continuous basis and send the Project Status Report to iDirect once a week via electronic mail. The status report will present the following details.

- · Progress of the project versus the plan (schedule). This should reflect the original estimates, the revised estimates and the current status (Done / In progress / Hold / No Hold).
- · Planned and unplanned activities completed this week.
- · Planned activities NOT completed.

---

- · Activities planned for the next week.
- · Resource utilization plan for the next week indicating available vs planned capacity
- · Issues/Concerns requiring iDirect's attention.
- · Problems faced and corrective actions taken.
- · Technical Notes (Changes made, etc.)
- · Summary of reviews / testing,

The status report will highlight any revisions to the plan, the risks and contingency plans.

## 3.3 Formal Reviews

Wipro review process as specified in Veloci-Q will be followed for conducting reviews of Wipro deliverables (documents and source code) before delivery to iDirect. iDirect shall review the work products and send their comments within 2 weeks, which will be analysed and incorporated, in the respective documents.

## 3.4 Escalation mechanism

Wipro's Project Manager will be ultimate responsible for resolving all issues internal to the project. In the event of an issue requiring resolution from Wipro, the first point of contact would be the project manager. The subsequent escalation path would be to the offshore technical manager and then to his / her manager.

Supply of additional Products or provision of additional Services may not be initiated by the Supplier without prior written consent from Customer, and without the Parties coming to an agreement as to the terms and conditions of the supply of such Products and / or the performance and remuneration of such Services. Agreement on terms and conditions of additional Products and/or Services will be the result of a different negotiation and will be integrated in an Addendum to the existing SOV, if any.

In case the Parties do not conclude the negotiations on the terms and conditions for additional Products and / or Services, each Party shall bear its respective costs related to the negotiations, and the progress of such effort shall not obligate either Party to the other.

During the course of the Project, the need to make changes to various Project aspects may arise. These potential changes will be documented in a Change Order, which is an authorised modification of the Project to alter the specifications, quality or any other provision of the relevant SOW (See Annex-I, Change Order form).

The Change Order document contains all information necessary to decide on the merits of a proposed change. CUSTOMER and SUPPLIER will finalise the authorisation procedures during the ramp-up of the Project.

The following information should be included:

- · Change request. a description of the requested change, justification for the change, and the originator of the request.

The Change Request may be initiated due to any of the following conditions:

- -Execution of a newly identified activities

Major changes in identified activities

- -Any changes in the targeted environment
- -Resources (Designer &amp; Hardware)

The change identified has to be documented and communicated between the Project Manager / Leader from Wipro and the iDirect Project Lead, in the form of a written document like e-mail. The onsite contact will mediate this communication.

- · Change proposal: a description of how the change would be accomplished, the price of implementing the change, impact on the schedule, and critical dates by which time a decision must be made.
- · Change authorization: signatures, effective dates and scheduled implementation date of change proposal agreed to by CUSTOMER.
